    <h1>Studio Ghibli</h1>
    <br>

    <p>
      Studio Ghibli, Inc. is a Japanese animation film studio based in Koganei,
      Tokyo, Japan. The studio is best known for its anime feature films, and has
      also produced several short films, television commercials, and one
      television film. Founded on <time datetime='1985-06-15'>15 June 1985<time>,
      Studio Ghibli is headed by the directors Hayao Miyazaki and Isao Takahata and the producer Toshio Suzuki.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name <b>Ghibli</b> was given by Hayao Miyazaki from the Italian noun <i>"ghibli"</i>,
      based on the Libyan-Arabic name for the hot desert wind of that country (sirocco),
      the idea being the studio would <q>blow a new wind through the anime industry</q>.
      It also refers to an Italian aircraft, the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caproni_Ca.309'
      target='_blank'>Caproni Ca.309 Ghibli</a>. Although
      the Italian word is more accurately transliterated as ギブリ (Giburi), the
      Japanese name of the studio is ジブリ (Jiburi).

      The studio has mainly produced films by Miyazaki, with the second most prolific
      director being Takahata (most notably with <cite>Grave of the Fireflies</cite>). Other
      directors who have worked with Studio Ghibli include
