      <h3>History</h3>
      <p>
        Founded on June 15, 1985, the studio is headed by the directors Hayao Miyazaki
        and Isao Takahata and the producer Toshio Suzuki. Prior to the formation of
        the studio, Miyazaki and Takahata had already had long careers in Japanese
        film and television animation and had worked together on <cite>Hols: Prince of the Sun</cite>
        and <cite>Panda! Go, Panda!</cite>; and Suzuki was an editor at Tokuma Shoten's
        <cite>Animage</cite> manga magazine.
      </p>
      <p>
        The studio was founded after the success of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nausica%C3%A4_of_the_Valley_of_the_Wind_(film)'
        target="_blank"><cite>Nausicaä of the Valle of the Wind</cite></a> (1984), with funding
        by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokuma_Shoten' target='_blank'>
        Tokuma Shoten</a>. <cite>Nausicaä of the Valle of the Wind</cite>, written and directed by Miyazaki for
        <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topcraft' target='_blank'>Topcraft</a>
        and distributed by <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toei_Company' target='_blank'>Toei Company</a>.
        The origins of the film lie in the first two volumes of a serialized manga
        written by Miyazaki for publication in <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animage' target='_blank'>
        <cite>Animage</cite></a> as a way of generating interest in an anime version.
        Suzuki was part of the production team on the film and founded Studio Ghibli
        with Miyazaki, who also invited Takahata to join the new studio.
      </p>
      <p>
        In August 1996, <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walt_Disney_Studios_Motion_Pictures'
        target='_blank'>Disney</a> and Tokuma Shoten Publishing agreed that Disney
        would distribute internationally Tokuma's Studio Ghibli animated films.
        Many of Ghibli's films in Japan are theatrically distributed by
        <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toho' target="_blank">Toho</a> while
        home video releases are handled by Walt Disney Studios Home Entertainment
        Japan. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Bunch_(company)' target="_blank">
        Wild Bunch</a> holds the international sales rights to many of Ghibli's
        films. Ghibli's main international distribution partners also include Disney
        (Japan Home Video, Taiwan, France), <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GKIDS'
        target="_blank">GKIDS</a> (North America), <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StudioCanal_UK'
        target="_blank">StudioCanal</a> (United Kingdom and Ireland), and
        <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madman_Entertainment' target="_blank">
        Madman Entertainment</a> (Australia).
        Germany-based Wild Bunch itself handles international sales for Studio Ghibli's works.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, there has been a close relationship between Studio Ghibli
        and the magazine <cite>Animage</cite>, which regularly runs exclusive articles on the
        studio and its members in a section titled <b>"Ghibli Notes"</b>. Artwork from
        Ghibli's films and other works are frequently featured on the cover of the
        magazine. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saeko_Himuro' target="_blank">
        Saeko Himuro's</a> novel <cite>Umi ga Kikoeru</cite> was serialised in the magazine
        and subsequently adapted into <cite>Ocean Waves</cite> (film), Studio Ghibli's only animated
        feature length film created for television and it was directed by
        <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomomi_Mochizuki' target="_blank">Tomomi Mochizuki</a>.
        Between 1999 and 2005 Studio Ghibli was a subsidiary of Tokuma Shoten, the publisher of <cite>Animage</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The studio is also known for its strict "no-edits" policy in licensing
        their films abroad due to <cite>Nausicaä of the Valley of Wind</cite> being heavily
        edited for the film's release in the United States as <cite>Warriors of the Wind</cite>.
        The "no cuts" policy was highlighted when <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miramax'
        target="_blank">Miramax</a> co-chairman <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvey_Weinstein'
        target="_blank">Harvey Weinstein</a> suggested editing <cite>Princess Mononoke</cite>
        to make it more marketable. A Studio Ghibli producer is rumoured to have
        sent an authentic Japanese sword with a simple message: "No cuts".
      </p>
      <p>
        On February 1, 2008, Toshio Suzuki stepped down from the position of Studio
        Ghibli president, which he had held since 2005, and Koji Hoshino (former
        president of Walt Disney Japan) took over. Suzuki said he wanted to improve
        films with his own hands as a producer, rather than demanding this from his
        employees. Suzuki decided to hand over the presidency to Hoshino because
        Hoshino has helped Studio Ghibli to sell its videos since 1996 and has also
        aided the release of the <cite>Princess Mononoke</cite> film in the United States.
        Suzuki still serves on the company's board of directors.

        In October 2001, the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghibli_Museum'
        target="_blank">Ghibli Museum</a> opened in Mitaka, Tokyo. It contains
        exhibits based on Studio Ghibli films and shows animations, including a
        number of short Studio Ghibli films not available elsewhere.
        Two Studio Ghibli short films created for the Ghibli Museum were shown at
        the Carnegie Hall Citywise Japan NYC Festival: <cite>House Hunting</cite> and
        <cite>Mon Mon the Water Spider</cite> were screened on March 26, 2011.
        Takahata developed a project for release after Gorō Miyazaki's (director
        of <cite>Tales from Earthsea</cite> and Hayao's son)
        <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_the_Princess_Kaguya' target="_blank">
        <cite>The Tale of the Princess Kaguya</cite></a> –
        an adaptation of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_the_Bamboo_Cutter'
        target="_blank"><cite>The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter</cite></a>. The last film Hayao Miyazaki
        directed before retiring from feature films was <cite>The Wind Rises</cite> which is
        about the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsubishi_A6M_Zero'
        target="_blank">Mitsubishi A6M Zero</a> and its founder.
      </p>
      <p>
        In March 2014, Toshio Suzuki retired as producer and assumed the new position
        of general manager. <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoshiaki_Nishimura'
        target="_blank">Yoshiaki Nishimura</a> replaced Suzuki in the producer role.
        On August 3, 2014, Toshio Suzuki announced that Studio Ghibli would take
        a "brief pause" to re-evaluate and restructure in the wake of Miyazaki's
        retirement. He stated some concerns about where the company would go in
        the future. This has led to speculation that Studio Ghibli will never produce
        another feature film again. On November 7, 2014, Miyazaki stated, "That was
        not my intention, though. All I did was announce that I would be retiring
        and not making any more features." Lead producer Yoshiaki Nishimura among
        several other staffers from Ghibli left to found Studio Ponoc in April 2015,
        working on the film <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_and_the_Witch%27s_Flower'
        target="_blank"><cite>Mary and the Witch's Flower</cite></a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In February 2017, Toshio Suzuki announced that Miyazaki had come out of
        retirement again to direct a new feature film, <cite>How Do You Live?</cite>,
        with Studio Ghibli. <cite>How Do You Live?</cite> title borrows from the 1937
        book of the same name, but apparently it will be loosely based on the book
        considering it will be a fantasy action-adventure slice of life story.
      </p>
      <p>
        On November 28, 2017, Koji Hoshino stepped down as President, he was replaced
        by Kiyofumi Nakajima (former Ghibli Museum director). Hoshino was then
        appointed as Chairman of Studio Ghibli.
