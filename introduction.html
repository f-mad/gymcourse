    Studio Ghibli, Inc. is a Japanese animation film studio based in Koganei,
    Tokyo, Japan. The studio is best known for its anime feature films, and has
    also produced several short films, television commercials, and one
    television film. Founded on <time datetime='1985-06-15'>15 June 1985<time>,
    Studio Ghibli is headed by the directors <a href="founders.html#Miyazaki">Hayao Miyazaki</a> and

    The name <b>Ghibli</b> was given by Hayao Miyazaki from the Italian noun <i>"ghibli"</i>,
    based on the Libyan-Arabic name for the hot desert wind of that country (sirocco),
    the idea being the studio would <q>blow a new wind through the anime industry</q>.
    It also refers to an Italian aircraft, the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caproni_Ca.309'

    the Italian word is more accurately transliterated as ギブリ (Giburi), the
    Japanese name of the studio is ジブリ (Jiburi).
