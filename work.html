          <td><cite>Grave of the Fireflies</cite> is a Japanese animated war drama film based on the 1967 semi-autobiographical<br>
            short story of the same name by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akiyuki_Nosaka" target="_blank">
            Akiyuki Nosaka</a>. It was written and directed by Isao Takahata,<br>
            and animated by Studio Ghibli for the story's publisher <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shinchosha" target="_blank">
            Shinchosha Publishing</a> (making it<br>
            the only Studio Ghibli film under Tokuma Shoten ownership that had no involvement from them).<br>
            Set in the city of Kobe, Japan, the film tells the story of two siblings, Seita and Setsuko,<br>
            and their desperate struggle to survive during the final months of the Second World War.<br>
            The film was critically acclaimed. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert"
            target="_blank">Roger Ebert</a> of the Chicago Sun-Times considered <br>
            it to be one of the best and most powerful war films and, in 2000, included it on his <br>
            "Great Movies" list. Two live-action remakes of Grave of the Fireflies were made, <br>
            one in 2005 and one in 2008. It is commonly described as an anti-war film, but this <br>
            interpretation has been denied by the director.
