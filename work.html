            Akiyuki Nosaka</a>.<br> It was written and directed by Isao Takahata,

            Shinchosha Publishing</a> (making it
            the only Studio Ghibli film under Tokuma Shoten ownership that had no involvement from them).<br>
            Set in the city of Kobe, Japan, the film tells the story of two siblings, Seita and Setsuko,
            and their desperate struggle to survive during the final months of the Second World War.<br>
            The film was critically acclaimed. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Ebert"
            target="_blank">Roger Ebert</a> of the Chicago Sun-Times considered
            it to be one of the best and most powerful war films and, in 2000, included it on his
            "Great Movies" list.<br> Two live-action remakes of Grave of the Fireflies were made,
            one in 2005 and one in 2008. It is commonly described as an anti-war film, but this
            interpretation has been denied by the director.

                by Isao Takahata, animated by Studio Ghibli for Tokuma Shoten, Nippon
                Television Network and Hakuhodo, and distributed by Toho.
                The phrase "Pom Poko" in the title refers to the sound of tanuki
                (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_raccoon_dog"
                target="_blank">Japanese raccoon dogs</a>) drumming their own bellies as a form of
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanuki-bayashi"
                target="_blank">tanuki-bayashi</a>. Specifically, the phrase started as a jocular
                explanation of meditative percussion at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shōjō-ji"
                target="_blank">Shōjō-ji</a> taken up in a 1919 poem by
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ujō_Noguchi" target="_blank">
                Ujō Noguchi</a>, which became a popular nursery rhyme recorded in 1925.<br>
                Consistent with Japanese folklore, the tanuki are portrayed as a
                highly sociable, mischievous species, who are able to use "illusion science"
                to transform into almost anything, but too fun-loving and too fond of
                tasty treats to be a real threat – unlike the <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitsune"
                target="_blank">kitsune</a></i> (foxes) and
                other shape-shifters. Visually, the tanuki in this film are depicted
                in three distinct ways at various times: as realistic animals, as
                anthropomorphic animals that occasionally wear clothes, and as cartoon-like
                figures based on the manga of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shigeru_Sugiura"
                target="_blank">Shigeru Sugiura</a> (of whom Takahata is a
                great fan). They tend to assume their realistic form when seen by
                humans, their cartoon-like form when they are doing something outlandish
                or whimsical, and their anthropomorphic form at all other times.<br>
                Prominent testicles are an integral part of tanuki folklore, and they
                are shown and referred to throughout the film, and also used frequently
                in their shape-shifting. This remains unchanged in the DVD release,
                though the English dub (but not the subtitles) refers to them as "raccoon pouches".
                Also, in the English dub and subtitles, the animals are never referred to as
                "raccoon dogs", which is the more accurate English name for the tanuki,
                instead they are incorrectly referred to as just "raccoons".</td>

                target="_blank">Spirited Away</a></cite> is a Japanese animated fantasy film written and directed by
              Hayao Miyazaki, animated by Studio Ghibli for Tokuma Shoten, Nippon Television Network,
              Dentsu, Buena Vista Home Entertainment, Tohokushinsha Film and Mitsubishi and
              distributed by Toho.<br>
              The film tells the story of Chihiro Ogino, a
              sullen ten-year-old girl who, while moving to a new neighborhood, enters
              the spirit world. After her parents are transformed into pigs by the witch
              Yubaba, Chihiro takes a job working in Yubaba's bathhouse to find a way
              to free herself and her parents and return to the human world.<br>
              Miyazaki wrote the script after he decided the film would be based on the
              10-year-old daughter of his friend, associate producer Seiji Okuda,
              who came to visit his house each summer.<br>
              The film became the most successful film in Japanese history, grossing
              over $289 million worldwide. The film overtook Titanic (at the time the
              top-grossing film worldwide) in the Japanese box office to become the
              highest-grossing film in Japanese history with a ¥30.4 billion total.

                target="_blank">Howl's Moving Castle</a></cite> is a Japanese animated fantasy film written and
              directed by Hayao Miyazaki. The film is loosely based on the <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howl%27s_Moving_Castle" target="_blank">
              novel of the same name</a> by British author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diana_Wynne_Jones"
              target="_blank">Diana Wynne Jones</a>. The film was produced by
              Toshio Suzuki, animated by Studio Ghibli and distributed by Toho.<br>
              The story is set in a fictional kingdom where both magic and early
              20th century technology are prevalent, against the backdrop of a war
              with another kingdom. The film tells the story of a young hatter named
              Sophie after she is turned into an old woman by a witch's curse. She
              encounters a wizard named Howl, and gets caught up in his resistance
              to fighting for the king.<br>
              Influenced by Miyazaki's opposition to the United States' invasion
              of Iraq in 2003, the film contains strongly anti-war themes. Miyazaki
              stated that he "had a great deal of rage about [the Iraq war]," which
              led him to make a film which he felt would be poorly received in the US.
              It also explores the theme of old age, depicting age positively as
              something which grants the protagonist freedom. The film contains
              feminist elements as well, and carries messages about the value of compassion.<br>
              In 2013 Miyazaki said the film was his favorite creation, explaining
              "I wanted to convey the message that life is worth living, and I
              don't think that's changed." The movie is thematically significantly
              different from the book; while the book focuses on challenging class
              and gender norms, the film focuses on love, and personal loyalty
              and the destructive effects of war."<br>

              film Miyazaki directed for Ghibli, and his tenth overall.<br> The plot
              centers on a goldfish named Ponyo who befriends a five-year-old human
              boy, Sōsuke, and wants to become a human girl.<br>
              Hayao Miyazaki, the film's director and writer, said his inspiration
              was the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Christian_Andersen"

              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Mermaid" target="_blank">
              The Little Mermaid</a></cite>, but his
              inspiration was more abstract than a story. Along with animation
              director Katsuya Kondo and art director Noboru Yoshida, Miyazaki devised
              a set of goals which included to use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Traditional_animation"
              target="_blank">traditional animation</a> entirely in <cite>Ponyo</cite>
              pursuing the animation and art possibilities without struggling under
              the demands of the production schedule, showing the quality of Yoshida's
              artwork as well as celebrating the innocence and cheerfulness of a child's universe.<br>
              Ponyo's name is an onomatopoeia, based on Miyazaki's idea of what a "soft,
              squishy softness" sounds like when touched.<br>
              The film earned over US$201 million worldwide and won several awards, including
              the Japan Academy Prize for Animation of the Year.

              inside a glowing bamboo shoot. Believing her to be a divine presence,
              he and his wife decide to raise her as their own, calling her "Princess".
              The girl grows rapidly and conspicuously, causing her parents to marvel
              and earning her the nickname "Takenoko" (Little Bamboo) from the other
              village children. Sutemaru, the oldest among Kaguya's friends, develops
              a close relationship with her.<br>
              It was the final film directed by Takahata, who died in April 2018.<br>
              It was released on 23 November 2013. At the budget of US$49.3 million,
              it is the most expensive Japanese movie to date. The film received
              critical acclaim and was nominated for the Academy Award for Best
              Animated Feature at the 87th Academy Awards.

                target="_blank">When Marnie Was There</a></cite> is a 2014 Japanese anime drama film written
              and directed by Hiromasa Yonebayashi, animated by Studio Ghibli.<br>
              It is based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joan_G._Robinson"
              target="_blank">Joan G. Robinson's</a> novel of the same name, although

              The film follows Anna Sasaki living with her relatives in the seaside
              town. Anna comes across a nearby abandoned mansion, where she meets
              Marnie, a mysterious girl who asks her to promise to keep their secrets

              Marnie, and eventually Anna learns the truth about her family and foster care.<br>
