      <h2>Hayao Miyazaki</h2>
      <img src='Hayao_Miyazaki.jpg' width='250' height='320' style='float:left'>
      <p>
        Hayao Miyazaki (Japanese: 宮崎 駿, born January 5, 1941) is a Japanese film
        director, producer, screenwriter, animator, author, and manga artist. A
        co-founder of Studio Ghibli, a film and animation studio, he has attained
        international acclaim as a masterful storyteller and as a maker of anime
        feature films, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest animation directors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Born in Bunkyō Ward of Tokyo, Miyazaki expressed interest in manga and
        animation from an early age, and he joined Toei Animation in 1963. During
        his early years at Toei Animation he worked as an in-between artist and later
        collaborated with director Isao Takahata.
      </p>
      <p>
        Miyazaki's works are characterized by the recurrence of themes such as
        humanity's relationship with nature and technology, the wholesomeness of
        natural and traditional patterns of living, the importance of art and craftsmanship,
        and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic in a violent world.
        The protagonists of his films are often strong girls or young women, and
        several of his films present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming
        qualities. Miyazaki's works have been highly praised and awarded; he was
        named a Person of Cultural Merit for outstanding cultural contributions in
        November 2012, and received the Academy Honorary Award for his impact on
        animation and cinema in November 2014. In 2002, American film critic Roger
        Ebert suggested that Miyazaki may be the best animation filmmaker in history,
        praising the depth and artistry of his films.
      </p>
      <p>
        Miyazaki forgoes traditional screenplays in his productions, instead developing
        the film's narrative as he designs the storyboards. <q>We never know where the
        story will go but we just keep working on the film as it develops</q> he said.
        In each of his films, Miyazaki has employed traditional animation methods,
        drawing each frame by hand; computer-generated imagery has been employed in
        several of his later films, beginning with <cite>Princess Mononoke</cite>, to "enrich the
        visual look", though he ensures that each film can <q>retain the right ratio
        between working by hand and computer ... and still be able to call my films 2D</q>.
        He oversees every frame of his films.

      <p>
        Isao Takahata (Japanese: 高畑 勲, born October 29, 1935 - April 5, 2018) was a Japanese film
        director, animator, screenwriter and producer who has earned critical
        international acclaim for his work as a director of anime films.
        Takahata does not draw and had not worked as an animator before he became
        a full-fledged director.
      </p>
      <p>
        After seeing a French animated cartoon feature called <cite>Le Roi et l'Oiseau</cite>
        (<cite>The King and the Mockingbird</cite>) he became intrigued by the animation that was used.
        After the graduation from University of Tokyo he started work as an assistant director
        in Toei Animation. His directorial debut was <cite>Hols: Prince of the Sun</cite> which
        unfortunately ended up being a commercial failure resulting in his demotion.
      </p>
      <p>
        While working in Toei Animation he met Hayao Miyazaki with whom he worked on
        <cite>Hols: Prince of the Sun</cite>. In 1972 Takahata directed Miyazaki's
        short film <cite>Panda! Go, Panda!</cite> Later he became producer of
        <cite>Nausicaä of the Valle of the Wind</cite> and after film's success was
        invited to join animation production company Studio Ghibli.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first movie directed by Takahata for Ghibli was <cite>Grave of the Fireflies</cite>.
        Takahata went on to do the music direction for Miyazaki when it came to
        <cite>Kiki's Delivery Service</cite>. On November 4, 2007, Takahata was awarded the
        Special Award at the Kobe Animation Awards.

      <h2>Toshio Suzuki</h2>
      <img src='Toshio_Suzuki.jpg' width="250" height="320" style='float:left'>
      <p>
        Toshio Suzuki (Japanese: 鈴木 敏夫, born August 19, 1948) is a film producer
        of anime and a long-time colleague of Hayao Miyazaki, as well as the former
        president of Studio Ghibli. Suzuki is renowned as one of Japan's most
        successful producers after the enormous box office success (in Japan) of many Ghibli films.
      </p>
      <p>
        His professional career started at Tokuma Shoten, joining the company shortly
        after graduation. He was assigned to the planning department of
        <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weekly_Asahi_Gein%C5%8D' target="_blank">Asahi Geino</a>,
        entertainment, magazine, where he was responsible for the manga coverage page.
        In 1973 he became the editor of the magazine's supplement <cite>Comic & Comic</cite>.
        In 1975 Suzuki was assigned to the editorial department of the monthly
        <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Land' target="_blank">Television Land</a>.
        In 1978 he became an editor for the, newly created, monthly magazine <cite>Animage</cite>,
        under its first editor-in-chief <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideo_Ogata'
        target="_blank">Hideo Ogata</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In his capacity as <cite>Animage</cite> editor he approached Isao Takahata and Miyazaki,
        who had worked on the animated feature film <cite>Hols: Prince of the Sun</cite>, for a
        feature article in the inaugural issue of the magazine but they declined.
        Suzuki and Miyazaki encountered each other again after the release of
        <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Castle_of_Cagliostro'
        target="_blank"><cite>The Castle of Cagliostro</cite></a> when Suzuki again
        approached Miyazaki for an <cite>Animage</cite> article. This time the
        meetings result in an enduring collaborative relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suzuki was among those who facilitated the creation and publication of Miyazaki's manga,
        <cite>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</cite>. He was instrumental in getting
        the <cite>Nausicaä</cite> anime made and helped establish Studio Ghibli
        after the film's release.
        The film was released on March 11, 1984. Studio Ghibli was founded in June
        1985. Miyazaki has stated, <q>If it were not for Mr. Suzuki, there wouldn't
        have been Studio Ghibli.</q>
      </p>
      <p>
        Suzuki was associate producer on <cite>Kiki's Delivery Service</cite> and officially joined
        the studio as producer in 1989, after he had resigned from Tokuma Shoten in October.
        In 1990 Suzuki was appointed director of the Studio Ghibli company. He was
        producer on <cite>Only Yesterday</cite> in 1991 and <cite>Porco Rosso</cite> in 1992.
        In 1995 Suzuki also became the producer on the next feature length Ghibli
        film project, released, in 1997, under the title he had selected, <cite>Princess Mononoke</cite>.
        In 1997 Studio Ghibli and Tokuma Shoten merged and Suzuki became the inaugural president.
      </p>
      <p>
        In March 2004, Studio Ghibli became independent from Tokuma Shoten and Suzuki
        was appointed Ghibli corporation president.
        He stepped down from the position in 2008. In March 2014 Suzuki retired
        as a producer and assumed a new position of general manager.
