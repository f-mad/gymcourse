    <h3>Hayao Miyazaki</h3>
    <div id='Miyazaki'><img class='pict' src='Hayao_Miyazaki.jpg' width='225' height='320'></div>
    <div class='describ'>
      <p>
      Hayao Miyazaki (Japanese: 宮崎 駿, born January 5, 1941) is a Japanese film
      director, producer, screenwriter, animator, author, and manga artist. A
      co-founder of Studio Ghibli, a film and animation studio, he has attained
      international acclaim as a masterful storyteller and as a maker of anime
      feature films, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest animation directors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Born in Bunkyō Ward of Tokyo, Miyazaki expressed interest in manga and
      animation from an early age, and he joined Toei Animation in 1963. During
      his early years at Toei Animation he worked as an in-between artist and later
      collaborated with director Isao Takahata.
     </p>
     <p>
      Miyazaki's works are characterized by the recurrence of themes such as
      humanity's relationship with nature and technology, the wholesomeness of
      natural and traditional patterns of living, the importance of art and craftsmanship,
      and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic in a violent world.
      The protagonists of his films are often strong girls or young women, and
      several of his films present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming
      qualities. Miyazaki's works have been highly praised and awarded; he was
      named a Person of Cultural Merit for outstanding cultural contributions in
      November 2012, and received the Academy Honorary Award for his impact on
      animation and cinema in November 2014. In 2002, American film critic Roger
      Ebert suggested that Miyazaki may be the best animation filmmaker in history,
      praising the depth and artistry of his films.
     </p>
     <p>
      Miyazaki forgoes traditional screenplays in his productions, instead developing
      the film's narrative as he designs the storyboards. <q>We never know where the
      story will go but we just keep working on the film as it develops</q> he said.
      In each of his films, Miyazaki has employed traditional animation methods,
      drawing each frame by hand; computer-generated imagery has been employed in
      several of his later films, beginning with <cite>Princess Mononoke</cite>, to "enrich the
      visual look", though he ensures that each film can <q>retain the right ratio
      between working by hand and computer ... and still be able to call my films 2D</q>.
      He oversees every frame of his films.

    <h3>Isao Takahata</h3>
    <div id='Takahata'><img class='pict' src='Isao_Takahata.jpg' width='225' height='320'></div>
    <div class='describ'>
      <p>
        Isao Takahata (高畑 勲 Takahata Isao, October 29, 1935 – April 5, 2018)
        was a Japanese film director, screenwriter and producer. In 1985, he co-founded
        Studio Ghibli with his long-time collaborative partner Hayao Miyazaki and
        Miyazaki's collaborators Toshio Suzuki and Yasuyoshi Tokuma. Takahata earned
        critical international acclaim for his work as a director of anime films,
        among them <cite>Grave of the Fireflies</cite> (1988), <cite>Only Yesterday</cite> (1991),
        <cite>Pom Poko</cite> (1994), and <cite>My Neighbors the Yamadas</cite> (1999).
        His last film as director was <cite>The Tale of the Princess Kaguya</cite> (2013),
        which was nominated for an Academy Award in the category Best Animated
        Feature Film at the 87th Academy Awards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Takahata was born in Ujiyamada (now Ise), Mie Prefecture, Japan, as the
        youngest of seven siblings and third son in the family.
        His father, Asajiro Takahata (1888–1984), was a junior high school principal,
        who became the education chief of Okayama prefecture after the war.
        On June 29, 1945, when Takahata was nine years old, he and his family survived
        a major United States air raid on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Okayama"
        target="_blank">Okayama City</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Takahata graduated from the University of Tokyo in 1959 with a degree in
        French literature. During this time at the school, he had seen the French
        film <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_King_and_the_Mockingbird"
        target="_blank">Le Roi et l'Oiseau</a></cite> (The King and the Mockingbird), which led him to
        become interested in animation. Takahata was more interested in animation
        as a medium, and wanted to write and direct for animated works rather than
        create animations himself. A friend suggested he apply for a directing job
        at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toei_Animation" target="_blank">Toei Animation</a>;
        Takahata passed their entrance exam, and was hired as an assistant director
        for several of Toei's animated television shows and films—including
        <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf_Boy_Ken" target="_blank">Wolf Boy Ken</a></cite>,
        on which he was mentored by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yasuo_Ōtsuka"
        target="_blank">Yasuo Ōtsuka</a>. Takahata left the studio in 1971, along
        with Miyazaki and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yōichi_Kotabe"
        target="_blank">Yōichi Kotabe</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Takahata, Kotabe, and Miyazaki were approached by the studio Zuiyo Enterprise
        to create an animated series based on the novel <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidi"
        target="_blank">Heidi</a></cite>, which resulted in
        <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heidi,_Girl_of_the_Alps" target="_blank">
        Heidi, Girl of the Alps</a></cite>.
        The animation production section of Zuiyo was established as a subsidiary
        company named Zuiyo Eizo, later becoming <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nippon_Animation"
        target="_blank">Nippon Animation</a>, which Takahata and Miyazaki joined.
        Takahata continued to work at Nippon for about a decade;
        his work there included an adaptation of <cite><a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_of_Green_Gables_(1979_TV_series)" target="_blank">
        Anne of Green Gables in 1979</a></cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Miyazaki approached Takahata with the idea of co-founding their own animation
        studio based on the success of <cite> Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</cite>;
        Studio Ghibli was subsequently formed in 1985 by Miyazaki, Takahata, and Miyazaki's
        collaborators Toshio Suzuki and Yasuyoshi Tokuma. The studio primarily released animated feature films
        that were directed by Miyazaki, with Takahata serving as producer or in other roles.
        Takahata did direct several Studio Ghibli films as well. His first, <cite>Grave of the Fireflies</cite>,
        released in 1988, was based on the semi-autobiographical short story of the
        same name written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akiyuki_Nosaka"
        target="_blank">Akiyuki Nosaka</a>, but Takahata was also partially inspired
        by his own experiences from the bombing of Okayama City. <cite>Grave of the Fireflies</cite>
        received critical acclaim for its emotional impact and anti-war themes, and is
        considered the film that established the international esteem of Studio Ghibli.
      </p>
      <p>
        Takahata had been diagnosed with lung cancer, and died on April 5, 2018,
        at a hospital in Tokyo, at the age of 82. On May 15, 2018, a farewell
        ceremony for Takahata was held at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ghibli_Museum"
        target="_blank">Ghibli Museum</a> in Tokyo.

    <h3>Toshio Suzuki</h3>
    <div id='Suzuki'><img class='pict' src='Toshio_Suzuki.jpg' width='225' height='320'></div>
    <div class='describ'>
      <p>
        Toshio Suzuki (鈴木 敏夫 Suzuki Toshio, born August 19, 1948) is a film producer
        of anime and a long-time colleague of Hayao Miyazaki, as well as the former
        president of Studio Ghibli. Suzuki is renowned as one of Japan's most successful
        producers after the enormous box office success (in Japan) of many Ghibli films.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suzuki was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nagoya" target="_blank">
        Nagoya</a> in Aichi Prefecture in 1948. In 1967 he enrolled
        at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keio_University" target="_blank">
        Keio University</a> and graduated with a degree in literature in 1972.
      </p>
      <p>
        His professional career started at Tokuma Shoten, joining the company shortly
        after graduation. He was assigned to the planning department of <cite>Asahi Geino</cite>,
        entertainment, magazine, where he was responsible for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manga"
        target="_blank">manga</a> coverage page.
        In 1973 he became the editor of the magazine's supplement <cite>Comic & Comic</cite>.
        In 1975 Suzuki was assigned to the editorial department of the monthly
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TV_Land" target="_blank">Television Land</a>.
        In 1978 he became an editor for the, newly created, monthly magazine <cite>Animage</cite>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In his capacity as Animage editor he approached Isao Takahata and Miyazaki,
        who had worked on the animated feature film <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hols:_Prince_of_the_Sun"
        target="_blank">Hols: Prince of the Sun</a></cite>, for
        a feature article in the inaugural issue of the magazine but they declined.
        Suzuki and Miyazaki encountered each other again after the release of
        <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Castle_of_Cagliostro" target="_blank">
        The Castle of Cagliostro</a></cite> when Suzuki again approached Miyazaki for an
        Animage article. This time the meetings result in an enduring collaborative
        relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
         Suzuki was among those who facilitated the creation and publication of
         Miyazaki's manga, <cite>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</cite>. He was instrumental
         in getting the <cite>Nausicaä</cite> anime made and helped establish Studio Ghibli after
         the film's release. The film was released on March 11, 1984. Studio Ghibli was
         founded in June 1985. Miyazaki has stated, "If it were not for Mr. Suzuki,
         there wouldn't have been Studio Ghibli."
      </p>
      <p>
         In 1986 Suzuki served on the production committee for the Studio Ghibli
         film <cite>Laputa: Castle in the Sky</cite> for Tokuma Shoten, released in August, and
         he succeeded <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hideo_Ogata" target="_blank">
         Ogata</a> as <cite>Animage</cite> editor-in-chief in October. In 1988 he again
         served on Tokuma Shoten's production committee. This time for the Ghibli
         films <cite>My Neighbor Totoro</cite>, directed by Miyazaki, and <cite>
         Grave of the Fireflies</cite> directed by Takahata. Suzuki was able to get
         the films made and released by proposing them as a double feature for theatrical release.
         He was associate producer on <cite>Kiki's Delivery Service</cite> and officially joined the studio as
         producer in 1989, after he had resigned from Tokuma Shoten in October.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1990 Suzuki was appointed director of the Studio Ghibli company. He was
        producer on <cite>Only Yesterday</cite> in 1991 and <cite>Porco Rosso</cite> in 1992. Suzuki was in
        charge of the <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean_Waves_(film)"
        target="_blank">Ocean Waves</a></cite> (film) project, directed by <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomomi_Mochizuki" target="_blank">Tomomi Mochizuki</a>,
        created by Studio Ghibli for television, which aired in Japan in 1993.
      </p>
      <p>
         In 1997 Studio Ghibli and Tokuma Shoten merged and Suzuki became the inaugural President.
         In March 2004, Studio Ghibli became independent from Tokuma Shoten and
         Suzuki was appointed Ghibli corporation president. He stepped down from
         the position in 2008.
         In March 2014 Suzuki retired as a producer and assumed a new position of general manager.
