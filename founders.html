      Hayao Miyazaki (Japanese: 宮崎 駿, born January 5, 1941) is a Japanese film
      director, producer, screenwriter, animator, author, and manga artist. A
      co-founder of Studio Ghibli, a film and animation studio, he has attained
      international acclaim as a masterful storyteller and as a maker of anime
      feature films, and is widely regarded as one of the greatest animation directors.
    </p>

      Born in Bunkyō Ward of Tokyo, Miyazaki expressed interest in manga and
      animation from an early age, and he joined Toei Animation in 1963. During
      his early years at Toei Animation he worked as an in-between artist and later
      collaborated with director Isao Takahata.

      Miyazaki's works are characterized by the recurrence of themes such as
      humanity's relationship with nature and technology, the wholesomeness of
      natural and traditional patterns of living, the importance of art and craftsmanship,
      and the difficulty of maintaining a pacifist ethic in a violent world.
      The protagonists of his films are often strong girls or young women, and
      several of his films present morally ambiguous antagonists with redeeming
      qualities. Miyazaki's works have been highly praised and awarded; he was
      named a Person of Cultural Merit for outstanding cultural contributions in
      November 2012, and received the Academy Honorary Award for his impact on
      animation and cinema in November 2014. In 2002, American film critic Roger
      Ebert suggested that Miyazaki may be the best animation filmmaker in history,
      praising the depth and artistry of his films.

      Miyazaki forgoes traditional screenplays in his productions, instead developing
      the film's narrative as he designs the storyboards. <q>We never know where the
      story will go but we just keep working on the film as it develops</q> he said.
      In each of his films, Miyazaki has employed traditional animation methods,
      drawing each frame by hand; computer-generated imagery has been employed in
      several of his later films, beginning with <cite>Princess Mononoke</cite>, to "enrich the
      visual look", though he ensures that each film can <q>retain the right ratio
      between working by hand and computer ... and still be able to call my films 2D</q>.
      He oversees every frame of his films.
